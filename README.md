## CSF HVA and 5-HIAA reference intervals Calculator

Run the app.R file to get the reference intervals for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) homovanillic (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acids (5-HIAA). Enter concentration value in nmol/L of the selected metabolite and enter age value (choose years or months units)

The proposed continuous reference intervals have been obtained from a cohort of pediatric patients (n = 1,533). CSF samples were analyzed via high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection at the Sant Joan de DÃ©u Hospital from 2000 to 2021. We strongly recommend to recalibrate the proposed intervals for application in other centers.
